The Hierarchy of Pure States (HOPS) is a stochastic numerical method to rigorously solve 
the full Schrödinger Equation for the system **and** its environment in a Monte-Carlo sense [1,2].
It is based on the stochastic pure state formalism governed by the Non-Markovian 
Quantum State Diffusion (NMQSD) equation [3], now reformulated in a hierarchical scheme
(similar to HEOM [4], a density matrix based approach to the same problem). 
In contrast to many "reduced" approaches (e.g. master equation techniques), no approximations on the 
level of the global Hamiltonian are required.
The method is exact in the sense that numerical errors can be made arbitrarily small, 
in a controlled way.
Details of HOPS have been discussed in Ref. [2,5,6]

processes continuously in time for a given auto-correlation-functions.
